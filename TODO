Ideas:
  *  add scrollbar:
  	Note that altough VteTerminal implements the GtkScrollable interface,
	you should not place a VteTerminal inside a GtkScrolledWindow
	container, since they are incompatible. Instead, pack the terminal in a
	horizontal GtkBox together with a GtkScrollbar which uses the
	GtkAdjustment returned from gtk_scrollable_get_vadjustment().

  *  when removing elements in terminal_chooser, update the tab labels (ie tab 1, tab7)
  *  try to catch event when new command launched in order to be able to go to
     last cursor position
  *  add button for creating terminal next to current one

  *  terminal manager tab: preview tab order rename
  	Try create a tab that displays extending tab informations (name,
	pixbuff, process, pid, dir) in treeview

  *   check pb when file empty (no universal selector)
  *   generate a plugin system and add the resize little window in it
