Main Ideas:
  *  Follow principles of GNOME/Gtk :
     - simplify the ui
  *  add main terminal emulator commands line support
  *  done create a way to hide terminals in the terminal overview
  	when terminal is unhidden, remove it from notebook @hidden
  *  create a way to push hidden terminals in a new topinambour window via the terminal overview
  *  find solution for warning :
     Gtk-WARNING **: Allocating size to topinambour-scrollbar 0x3d78710 without\\
     calling gtk_widget_get_preferred_width/height(). How does the code know the\
     size to allocate?

Why not ?:

  *  add button for creating terminal next to current one

  *  terminal manager tab: preview tab order rename
  	Try create a tab that displays extending tab informations (name,
	pixbuff, process, pid, dir) in treeview

  *   check pb when file empty (no universal selector)
  *   generate a plugin system and add the resize little window in it
  *  try to catch event when new command launched in order to be able to go to
     last cursor position
  * topinambour backend could be a server ? this could allow to move tab to different
    window.
