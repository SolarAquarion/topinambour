Urgent:
  centralize all the properties in lib/style_properties.rb
  add regex like color (hexadecimal and rgb like in css) with button in contextual menu for it
  generate a preferences window/ tab in order to set them easily
  generate a plugin system and add the resize little window in it

Ideas:
  Use a treeview or listbox for terminal chooser
  Try create a tab that displays extending tab informations (name, pixbuff, process, pid, dir) in treeview
  Allow rename tab in terminal chooser
