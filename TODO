Urgent:
  see where is the problem with the regex copied from gnome-terminal
  finish the tests for the regex
  Use a module to manage css properties

  ubuntu => try add check vor methods that are specific to last Gtk version (ubuntu trusty)

Ideas:
  Use a treeview or listbox for terminal chooser
  Try create a tab that displays extending tab informations (name, pixbuff, process, pid, dir) in treeview
  Allow rename tab in terminal chooser
  start testing regex
