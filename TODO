Ideas:
  label in terminal_overview:
  	when drag label must be changed as well
	when terminal closed , label must be deleted (maybe it is already implemented via grid line deletion)
	click on label should allow to rename tab

  terminal manager tab: preview tab order rename
  	Try create a tab that displays extending tab informations (name, pixbuff, process, pid, dir) in treeview
  Allow rename tab in tab chooser
  check pb when file empty (no universal selector)
  generate a plugin system and add the resize little window in it
