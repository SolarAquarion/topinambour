Ideas:
  *  Follow principles of GNOME/Gtk :
     - use gsettings for configuration (remove all the topinambour css props)
     - remove dependency to sass
     - simplify the ui
     - rework the properties window ui
  *  add file selector for different css config (default one symbolic link ?)
  *  try to catch event when new command launched in order to be able to go to
     last cursor position
  *  add button for creating terminal next to current one

  *  terminal manager tab: preview tab order rename
  	Try create a tab that displays extending tab informations (name,
	pixbuff, process, pid, dir) in treeview

  *   check pb when file empty (no universal selector)
  *   generate a plugin system and add the resize little window in it
